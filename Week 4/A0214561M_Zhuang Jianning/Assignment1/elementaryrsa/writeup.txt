given n, e and c

factorise n to prime numbers p and q using factordb.com

calculate phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
calculate d = inverse(e, phi) need import inverse from Crypto.Util.number
calculate m = pow(c, d, n) by decrypting with private key (d, n)
print long_to_bytes(m) need import long_to_bytes from Crypto.Util.number
