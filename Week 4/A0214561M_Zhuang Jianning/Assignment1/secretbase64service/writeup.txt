notice that 3 hex characters (3X4=12 bits) map to 2 base64 characters (2x6 characters)

e.g 0x000 => nn, 0x001 => nj

generate all possible 3 hex character = 16x16x16 = 4098 possible combinations

netcat to 4002 and use service 1) to find mapping

create a dictionary to map output to input

break the encoded flag into 2 characters and map using the dictionary to get flag
